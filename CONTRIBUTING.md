3. **Discuss your approach** with maintainers before starting large changes

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

    - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   flutter test
   
   # Run tests with coverage
   flutter test --coverage
   
   # Test on different platforms
   flutter test -d chrome  # Web
   flutter test -d macos   # Desktop
   ```

4. **Update documentation**
    - Add/update code comments
    - Update README.md if needed
    - Add examples for new features

5. **Commit your changes**

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### Dart Code Style

- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines
- Use `dart format` to format your code
- Use `dart analyze` to check for issues
- Maximum line length: 80 characters

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples for new features
- Update API documentation for public methods
- Use proper markdown formatting

### Example Code Style

```dart
/// Configures authentication for the NetGuard instance.
/// 
/// This method sets up automatic token refresh, logout handling,
/// and retry mechanisms for authenticated requests.
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// netGuard.configureAuth(
///   callbacks: AdvanceAuthCallbacks(
///     initialToken: 'your_token',
///     onRefreshToken: () async => await refreshToken(),
///   ),
/// );
/// ```
void configureAuth({
  required AdvanceAuthCallbacks callbacks,
  AuthConfig config = const AuthConfig(),
}) {
  // Implementation...
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all public methods
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies

### Test Structure

```dart
group('NetGuard Authentication', () {
  late NetGuard netGuard;
  
  setUp(() {
    netGuard = NetGuard();
  });
  
  test('should configure auth with valid callbacks', () {
    // Arrange
    final callbacks = AdvanceAuthCallbacks(/* ... */);
    
    // Act
    netGuard.configureAuth(callbacks: callbacks);
    
    // Assert
    expect(netGuard.isAuthenticated(), isTrue);
  });
  
  test('should handle token refresh failure gracefully', () async {
    // Test implementation...
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/netguard_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
lcov --summary coverage/lcov.info
```

## üì± Platform-Specific Considerations

### Mobile (iOS/Android)
- Test network connectivity scenarios
- Verify background app handling
- Test with different screen sizes

### Web
- Ensure CORS compatibility
- Test with different browsers
- Verify service worker compatibility

### Desktop
- Test file system permissions
- Verify native HTTP client behavior
- Test window focus/blur scenarios
